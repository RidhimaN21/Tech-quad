      <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It uses tags to structure content, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and forms. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and can have attributes that provide additional information or styling. HTML organizes content hierarchically, with a root <html> tag containing <head> and <body> sections. It forms the foundation of web development, allowing designers and developers to create structured, accessible, and interactive websites by defining how elements should be displayed and behave in browsers.</p>

      <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) enhances the presentation of HTML content in web pages. It defines styles like colors, fonts, layouts, and animations to customize the appearance of elements. Selectors target specific HTML elements or classes, applying rules to control their visual attributes. CSS offers flexibility and efficiency by separating content from design, allowing for consistent styling across multiple pages. It supports responsive design for various devices and screen sizes. CSS frameworks and preprocessors streamline development, while modern CSS features like Flexbox and Grid simplify layout creation, making CSS a crucial tool for web designers and developers.</p>

It supports functions, objects, arrays, and control structures for building complex applications. It's versatility extends beyond the web, being used for server-side programming, game development, and mobile app development thereby making JS a ubiquitous language in software development.</p>
